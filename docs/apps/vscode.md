## Overview

VSCode and VSCodium integration for dynamic theming.

## Installation

1. **Extension**: Install the `caelestia-vscode-integration` extension (typically provided as a `.vsix` in the main repo).
2. **Settings**:
   - Symlink `settings.json` to your User directory.
   - Or manually set the theme to **Catppuccin Mocha** (the extension overrides colors on top of this).

## Usage

The extension listens for theme changes from the Caelestia system and updates the editor colors in real-time.
