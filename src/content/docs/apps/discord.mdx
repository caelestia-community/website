## Overview

BetterDiscord/Vencord theme integration using the "Midnight (Caelestia)" theme.

## Installation

The Caelestia installer typically handles this for standard Discord.

### Troubleshooting

**Theme not showing up?**
If you use a different client like `vesktop` or `webcord`, you map need to specify it during install or manually copy the theme.

Example manually installing for Vesktop:

```bash
caelestia install discord vesktop
```

**Theme name**: "Midnight (Caelestia)".
