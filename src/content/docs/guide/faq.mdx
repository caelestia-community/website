# FAQ

## My screen is flickering, help pls!

Try disabling VRR in the hyprland config. You can do this by adding the following to `~/.config/caelestia/hypr-user.conf`:

```conf
misc {
    vrr = 0
}
```

## I want to make my own changes to the hyprland config!

You can add your custom hyprland configs to `~/.config/caelestia/hypr-user.conf`.

## I want to make my own changes to other stuff!

See the [manual installation](./installation.md#manual-installation) section for the corresponding repo.

## I want to disable XXX feature!

Please read the [Configuration](./configuration.md) section in the guide. If there is no corresponding option, make a feature request.

## How do I make my colour scheme change with my wallpaper?

Set a wallpaper via the launcher or `caelestia wallpaper` and set the scheme to the dynamic scheme via the launcher or `caelestia scheme set`.

```sh
caelestia wallpaper -f <path/to/file>
caelestia scheme set -n dynamic
```

## My wallpapers aren't showing up in the launcher!

The launcher pulls wallpapers from `~/Pictures/Wallpapers` by default. You can change this in the config. Additionally, the launcher only shows an odd number of wallpapers at one time. If you only have 2 wallpapers, consider getting more (or just putting one).
