# Caelestia Shell

This repository is the home of the Caelestia Shell community website. Caelestia Shell was created by [soramanew], who has graciously [given us permission] to create a website for the project.

At this point, the website itself is just an idea - so you probably want the [Caelestia Shell repository] or [Caelestia dotfiles repository]. In the future, we hope to make this site the definitive home for information regarding Caelestia Shell.
