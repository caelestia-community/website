# QT Configuration

> [!WARNING]
> This repository has been archived and merged into the main [Caelestia](https://github.com/caelestia-dots/caelestia) repository.

## Overview

QT theming for Caelestia Dots is now handled by the core `caelestia` package.
It uses `qt5ct` and `qt6ct` with the [Darkly](https://github.com/Bali10050/Darkly) theme or similar custom color schemes.

## Installation

If you installed the full Caelestia dots, this is already configured.

### Manual Setup

Ensure `qt5ct` and `qt6ct` are installed.
The theme files should be in your `~/.config/qt5ct` and `~/.config/qt6ct` directories, or managed via the Caelestia CLI.
