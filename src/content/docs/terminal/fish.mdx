# Fish Shell

The terminal is more than just a command prompt; in Caelestia, it's a productivity powerhouse.

We choose **Fish (Friendly Interactive SHell)** because out of the box, it offers features that other shells require complex plugins to achieve. It is colorful, smart, and user-friendly by default.

## The Caelestia Terminal Experience

Your terminal environment is capable of much more than standard Bash.

### 1. Intelligent Autosuggestions

As you type, Fish suggests commands based on history and completions.

- **Right Arrow (`→`)**: Accept the suggestion.
- **Alt + Right Arrow**: Accept one word of the suggestion.

### 2. Syntax Highlighting

Commands are highlighted as you type. Red means the command is invalid or not found; blue/green means it's valid. This gives you instant feedback before you even press Enter.

### 3. Starship Prompt

We use [Starship](https://starship.rs) to provide a cross-shell, customizable, and extremely fast prompt. It shows you:

- **Directory**: Current path.
- **Git Status**: Branch, changes, stashed files.
- **Package Versions**: Python, Node, Rust versions when relevant files are detected.
- **Execution Time**: How long the last command took (if it was slow).

### 4. Fastfetch

Every time you open a new terminal window, you are greeted by `fastfetch`, giving you a quick snapshot of your system status, kernel version, and uptime, styled with Caelestia branding.

## Key Abbreviations

Caelestia comes with a suite of abbreviations to make common tasks faster. These expand into full commands when you press Space or Enter.

## Configuration

### Fish Config

File: `~/.config/fish/config.fish`

This works just like `.bashrc`. You can look at the [official Fish documentation](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html) to learn the syntax.

To add your own alias:

```fish
alias helloworld "echo Hello, World!"
```

To add to the `$PATH` persistently:

```fish
fish_add_path /path/to/my/bin
```

### Starship Config

File: `~/.config/starship.toml`

Everything in the prompt is configurable. If you want to disable the NodeJS module, for example:

```toml
[nodejs]
disabled = true
```

### Fastfetch Config

File: `~/.config/fastfetch/config.jsonc`

You can customize the logo, the information displayed, or colors here.

## Switching to Bash/Zsh?

While Caelestia defaults to Fish, if you must use POSIX-compliant shells (like for specific scripting work):

1.  **Don't uninstall Fish**: Caelestia scripts might rely on it.
2.  **Change Default Shell**: `chsh -s /bin/bash`.
3.  **Porting**: You will lose the abbreviations and syntax highlighting unless you manually configure Zsh with plugins like `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting`.
