## Overview

A Firefox/Zen theme with dynamic colors.

## Installation

The setup involves two parts: a native app to communicate with the system, and a browser extension.

1. **Native App**: Installed via the main Caelestia setup (symlinks manifest to `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/`).
2. **Extension**: Install the [CaelestiaFox Addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/caelestiafox).

## Usage

The extension communicates with the Caelestia system to sync browser colors with your wallpaper/theme automatically.
